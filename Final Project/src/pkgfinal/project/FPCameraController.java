* Date Last Modified: 11/12/2017 
* 
* Purpose: This class will be used to control the camera in a first-person view.
*          It has methods to move the player around the screen, as well as
*          control the direction the player is looking. It has the gameLoop
*          method that is responsible for getting the user actions (what buttons
*          are pressed) and the render method that draws the cube on the screen.
* 
* Possible actions:
*       * The w,a,s,d keys and the arrow keys control the direction the player
*         moves around the screen
*       * The space bar moves the user up and the left shift key moves the player
*         down
*       * By moving the mouse around the screen, the player can look around
*       * The escape key closes the window and exits the program
